# PTO_Tracker
A data-organizing program implemented in Google Sheets. Automatically updates time off calendars for employees based on reports from RUN ADP.
Designed for a small (<=20 employees) to keep track of time off requests from employees.

This project was created 99% in Apps Script as an educational challenge for learning Javascript and produced a well-defined and reliable v1.0.

This repo serves as a showcase rather than a practical program as it was customized to fit a start-up's needs.
